//Ah, so the program below does not work because star delimiters can't be used inside an iteration of themselves.
#include <iostream>
	int main() {
		/* I call comments like these star comments for reasons I really can't point back to.
			Maybe because these comments have the power to span a couple lines.
				Or maybe because they use /* and */ as the starting and ending delimiters */
		std::cout << "Does this work? Of course it does!" << std::endl;
